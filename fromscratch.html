                <ul>
                    <li>After years of a long drought, Oroville, California experienced heavy rainfall.</li>
                    <li>There was erosion damage to the main spillway leading water from Lake Oroville to the Feather River.</li>
                    <li>In fear that the main spillway would collapse, officials enlisted the help of the emergency spillway, which also began to fail. Thinking the whole thing would collapse, 180,000 citizens were evacuated (I was one of them).</li>

                <ul>
                    <li>On November 8 in Paradise, California, a faulty electric line started what would be California's most destructive and deadliest fire.</li>
                    <li>There were at least 85 civilian fatalities, 12 civilian injuries, and 5 firefighter injuries. About 95% of the town's structures were lost. The remaining suffered severe smoke damage.</li>
                    <li>This fire was unlike any other I had seen. At the beginning of school, I had seen a big plume of smoke over the city of Paradise. Three hours later, my mom pulled me out of school to go help evacuees. A couple of days later, my family had been evacuated.</li>

            <ul>
                <li>21 fires were started by lightning on August 17 in the Plumas National Forest. Two of the fires failed to be put out and threatened the town of Oroville.</li>
                <li>There were 16 fatalities and more than 100 injuries.</li>
                <li>My family was evacuated around midnight on September 8. The smoke was so thick that the headlights on our cars could not penetrate it. When we were in a safe place, my parents started making phone calls to family members for places we could stay while we looked for permanent housing. Overnight, the winds were miraculously shifted, and our house did not burn down.</li>
